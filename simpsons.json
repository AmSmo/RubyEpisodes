While at the party, Homer is invited to dance on stage with a stripper. Bart (who is dining with the rest of the family in the next-door restaurant) uses his camera to snap a photo of Homer and the dancer having a great time. At school, Martin develops the picture, which - after he compliments Bart's work - gets distributed around school, and eventually around town. Marge sees the photo and is outraged. Homer arrives home, where Marge immediately confronts her husband and kicks him out of the house. Eventually, Marge agrees to let him back in on the condition he take Bart around to meet the stripper and show that she is not a sex object. After almost winding up on stage at another of the dancer's performances, Homer does as he is asked and all is forgiven.",

Bart is convinced that he is innocent, with Lisa's help, eventually deduces that someone was trying to frame him. Tying information together from news reports, their own knowledge and logical reasoning, Bart and Lisa expose Krusty's sidekick, Sideshow Bob as the culprit. Bob, it seems, had grown weary of being the butt of Krusty's physical gags and being part of an inane show, and with Krusty out of the way he could reshape the show into his more scholastic vision. Bob is arrested and swears revenge, while Krusty is freed.",

Homer encourages Bart to donate, anticipating getting a big reward from Burns in exchange for saving his life. When Bart gives his blood and no reward comes (only a thank-you card), Homer gets angry and writes a nasty letter to Burns. Marge intervenes and talks Homer out of mailing the letter. However, Bart, not perceiving that Homer had second thoughts, discovers and mails the letter. Chaos ensues as Homer and Bart try to retrieve the letter before Burns receives it.",

Although nobody is hurt, Principal Skinner finds out that Otto is unlicensed and fires him; Skinner takes over the job, but is a little too overcautious (unlike his predecessor). Meanwhile, the now jobless Otto is soon evicted from his apartment and forced to move in with the Simpsons. Otto just wants to lay around the house and play guitar, which irritates Homer, but Otto's attitude gets worse when he is unable to pass his driver's exam, despite several tries. When Homer confronts Otto about his laziness, Otto declares that he plans to staple his new license to Homer's head once he passes the test ....",
